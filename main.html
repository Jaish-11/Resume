                <h3> Plant Disease Recognition using Xception and DenseNet121 Modeling</h3>
                <p>This project uses tensordash libraries and Xception, DenseNet121 models to effective train the Machine Learning Algorithm to classify the given data into 4 classes : <br />

                    Multiple disease, Rust, Scab and Healthy.<br />
                    
                    Thereby, identifying whether a plant is diseased or healthy and segregating it into the above disease types.</p>

            <li>
                <h3> Handwriting Recognition Using CRNN</h3>
                <p>This project presents a deep learning approach for handwritten text recognition utilizing the Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) architecture implemented using the Keras library and TensorFlow backend. <br />
                    The objective is to develop a system capable of recognizing and transcribing handwritten text from image data, with a specific focus on recognizing handwritten names. <br />
                    The proposed solution employs a CRNN model, which combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) layers, to model the sequential nature of handwritten text. <br />
                    This architecture leverages the ability of CNNs to learn spatial patterns while capturing the temporal dependencies in the data using BiLSTM layers. <br /> </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3> Library Management System</h3>
                <p>The SLMS incorporates key features such as member management, book management, and issue and return functionalities. <br />
                    Moreover, it integrates Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to streamline book tracking and enhance the user borrowing experience. <br />
                    Through a phased approach encompassing system design, implementation, and testing, significant progress has been made towards the development of the SLMS. <br />
                    This project holds promise in revolutionizing library management, empowering librarians with advanced tools to optimize collections and deliver superior services to patrons.</p>

                <h3> Stock Market Analysis and Prediction Using LSTM</h3>
                <p>A long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network model that can analyze real-time stock market data to uncover complex non-linear patterns and make predictive price projections. <br />
                    The model incorporates technical indicators like moving averages alongside past prices to detect signals in the noise of the market.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3> Hospital DataBase Management System</h3>
